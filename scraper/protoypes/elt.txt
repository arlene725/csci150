                The campus just feels like home to me. It has a park kind of vibe to it and there are squirrels everywhere. Definitely recommend learning how to ride a long board or a skateboard, if not bring a scooter. The library is by far my favorite place to be and everyone is so friendly! I know Fresno is not the safest but I feel safe on campus.

                Just transferred here and I like it a lot! There are so many clubs and awesome classes. Some of the buildings here are a little outdated but the newer ones are great! I especially love that this campus has a fairly big CDDS program which is something that I'm interested in. Also the Bulldog Express is the most genius thing ever

                I honestly love Fresno State! When I was in high school, I knew for a fact I belonged at Fresno State. I feel like everyone here is really nice, and everyone is proud to be a Bulldog. I love the school spirit which makes me proud every day to be able to attend CSU Fresno.

                CSU Fresno is a great school with many opportunities. People are very friendly and are willing to help you, if you're ever having trouble with anything. A lot of beautiful people all around, from different backgrounds. Very diverse. Also, if you're 21, and over, the bar or the club is the best spot

                Campus is nice. Some buildings are a bit run down, some are really nice (lab school reaks of rotting everything, while science 2 is modern and smells like leather). The people are very nice, but too many students just want to party. Club involvement is low, sadly (I just started a club, and I am involved in two other clubs). Professors rock here.

                I have always had a level of fondness and respect for this university. I am proud to be a Fresno State student and look forward to the day I graduate from here!

                Depends on your major that you are studying. Research the school before you apply. Some majors offer a few courses while the rest are electives unrelated to your major.

                If you're thinking of coming here because of the Linguistics-TESOL program, you should really go somewhere else.  The TESOL program here is a 'why bother?!' situation. There's very little focus on 'Teaching," and  most ofwhat you will study has little application toward teaching English.  It's pretty pathetic.  Don't waste your time.

                Fresno State is so underrated. Most people who talk down on Fresno State are the ones that are doing bad in school, aren't involved, or aren't informed about all the great things the school has to provide. I am very thankful to attend Fresno State and proud to be part of such a giving community.

                Fresno State is definitely not as bad as the reputation it has gotten over the years. It's very cozy and has a friendly environment. Yes, the school is a little old structurally but they're working on that every year. Theres always some sort of construction going on to better the campus.

                Awesome school, great teachers, cool people. People talk down on Fresno because it's a bad place or whatever but I love Fresno State, it's a great place to be. I'm not even from Fresno but I don't see myself going to school anywhere else. Go Bulldogs!

                Besides the annoying amount of car jerseys that spontaneously pop up every football season, the scenery is actually pretty decent here. I really enjoy the what this school has to offer, from its huge library to the student union. When you're not studying there is plenty to do, and a fair amount of restaurants to eat at. GO DOGS!!!
